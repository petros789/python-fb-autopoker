python-fb-autopoker
===================

Facebook Auto Poker written in Python. 

Just put in your email and password and your on your way. It will run and loop back poking people until you stop. Also there is no need to install any external libraries, it runs on the ones that come standard in python. Do also note that if you kill and restart the script to many times within a small period of time Facebook will temporarily block logging in with the script.
